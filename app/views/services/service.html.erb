          <p>Hospitalization often signals instability in a patient's condition. This often requires changes in the way patients and their families manage at home after discharge from hospital.
          <br/>Due to the changes in the patient's medical condition, care needs, etc. this is a highly stressful situation. Ninkatec can help to monitor patients' health after discharge and coordinate the care needed at home.
